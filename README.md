This repository contains my first Sui Move program, designed to perform basic arithmetic operationsâ€”*addition* and *subtraction*â€”using the Move language on the Sui blockchain.

## ðŸ“˜ Description

This is a beginner-friendly project aimed at exploring the fundamentals of Move programming. The main focus is to:
